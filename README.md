Weather App using C# and Blazor
  A responsive web application built with C# (back-end) and Blazor (front-end) in Visual Studio. The app fetches real-time        weather data using the OpenWeatherMap API and provides a personalized experience for users through:

  Supabase Authentication for secure sign-up/login.

  MongoDB integration to store user search history and like/dislike interactions.

  A dashboard displaying weather data for Top 5 Global and Indian cities.

  Working on to add a like feature using MongoDB for the database.

This project demonstrates full-stack development with API integration, user authentication, and database management in a real-world application.
